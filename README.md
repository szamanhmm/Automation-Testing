# Automation-Testing
The testing environment utilized PyCharm IDE with Pytest and Selenium 
for automation testing, employing the Edge browser. Emphasizing a 
black-box testing approach, validation techniques included positive and 
negative scenario validations, equivalence partitioning, and boundary 
value analysis. The selection of PyCharm IDE alongside Pytest facilitated 
the creation and execution of test cases, while Selenium, coupled with 
the Edge browser, allowed for automated testing. <be>
